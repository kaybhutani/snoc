SNOC - Social Network of College

SNOC is an open source project which targets some problems faced by college students.
Anyone willing to contribute can mail his resume at kbhutani0001@gmail.com
Technology used - Python, Flask, Mongodb, Javascript

Problems:
1. Students don't get notified about workshops and events going around in their college.
2. Material and information sharing is limited to whatsapp groups only.

SNOC is targetting such problem and some related problems in the future too.

Working:
User can log in and see upcoming events and workshop in a Calendar.
Feed has all the posts and details which society right now posts on facebook and other networks.
Society channels which they can join and share the material and stuff.
Later we are thinking of allowing user to link their handles of coding platforms like codechef, hackerrank etc.
So that they only have to share link of this profile in resume, hence making it easy for recruiters and friends to check their stats.
